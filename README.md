# TriviaGame
Overview
This Trivia game is built using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. Three questions randomly generated with countdown timer for the answer. To be more stylish; I put the countdown timer as a progress bar, the progress bar will be displayed in the bottom of the page and runs as a timer bar. If the user runs out of time/the progress bar indicator, the "wrong!" message will be displayed in the screen.
After three questions, app will display score with the option to restart the game. The user did not need to refresh the screen as there is already an option to reset the game.
